OFFICE MANIA

Office Mania is a lighthearted top-down shooter inspired by the Daredevil TV show where you play as an office worker who is tired of being overworked and underpaid at your company. Finally deciding enough is enough, you decide to go on a rampage to expose the boss and his company for all their wrong doings. You have no guns of your own, but you can pick up and throw objects at enemies -- the entire office is your playground!

Controls
• WASD moves the player 
• Use the mouse to look around
* Walk over objects to pick them up
• Left-click to throw objects (if an object is being held)
• Hold left-click to charge up a throw so objects can be thrown further
• Right-click the mouse when near heavy objects to pick them up (though any currently held object will be dropped)
* ESC pauses the game

Notes
In case a level becomes unbeatable, a level can be restarted by pushing R when in-game or from the pause menu by clicking "Restart Level."

There is no level select in the game, but the player can skip to the next level by pushing N. It is up to the player as to whether they want to abuse this.

Tips
• Try to always stay on the move. Aggression is often the best way to win fights.
• Enemies will rotate their arms backwards whenever they are about to throw an object, unless they pick up a heavy object close to you.
• Enemies can hurt you if you bump into them. Be careful whenever you pick up objects that are close to them!
• Sometimes, it may be better to wait for enemies to throw objects at you. 
• Health pickups can generally be found in optional areas, but keep in mind that you will need to clear those areas to get the health and progress.
• The boss fight has two health pickups that spawn whenever enemies come in. More sharp objects can also be found near the health pickups.

Known Issues 
• The intro text and/or the outro text will sometimes not play (e.g., it might just "Y" at the beginning). Refreshing the page can fix this.
• Heavy objects can be thrown through walls (and potentially go out of bounds). This isn't exactly gamebreaking, but it does deprive you of one heavy object
• Throwing objects into rooms and successfully hitting enemies may cause the player to be locked out. To avoid this, walk into the room first before throwing objects
• AI can freeze up when trying to get to an object outside of their assigned area
• Bumping into objects that seemingly move slow can still hit and damage you sometimes
• Enemies who hold heavy objects can sometimes push players into walls if they are next to one
• The sound effect for whenever heavy objects hit someone may trigger whenever the player picks up a heavy object
